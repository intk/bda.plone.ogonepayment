The table above summarises the possible statuses of the payments.

Statuses in 1 digit are 'normal' statuses:

    * 0 means the payment is invalid (e.g. data validation error) or the processing is not complete either because it is still underway, or because the transaction was interrupted. If the cause is a validation error, an additional error code (*) (NCERROR) identifies the error.
    * 1 means the customer cancelled the transaction.
    * 2 means the acquirer did not authorise the payment.
    * 5 means the acquirer autorised the payment.
    * 9 means the payment was captured.

Statuses in 2 digits correspond either to 'intermediary' situations or to abnormal events. When the second digit is:

    * 1, this means the payment processing is on hold.
    * 2, this means an unrecoverable error occurred during the communication with the acquirer. The result is therefore not determined. You must therefore call the acquirer's helpdesk to find out the actual result of this transaction.
    * 3, this means the payment processing (capture or cancellation) was refused by the acquirer whilst the payment had been authorised beforehand. It can be due to a technical error or to the expiration of the authorisation. You must therefore call the acquirer's helpdesk to find out the actual result of this transaction.
    * 4, this means our system has been notified the transaction was rejected well after the transaction was sent to your acquirer.
    * 5, this means our system hasnâ€™t sent the requested transaction to the acquirer since the merchant will send the transaction to the acquirer himself, like he specified in his configuration.
